	<p align="left">I am currently a second-year PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of Washington, 
		with broad interest in graphical models and statistical learning methods. Since September 2018, 
		I have been working with <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/katiek/index.html">Dr. Katie Kerr</a> 
		as a research assistant. Our work includes evaluating biomarkers for prognostic enrichment of clinical trials, 
		particularly for those with survival outcomes. I am also working with 
		<a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ashojaie/">Dr. Ali Shojaie</a> on regularization methods for doubly stochastic spatial point processes.</p>
	
	<p align="left"> I obtained my MS degree in Biostatistics at Yale University, where I worked with 
		<a href="http://www.crawfordlab.io/">Dr. Forrest Crawford</a>
		on estimating hard-to-reach populations in social networks, and in particular, the large-sample behavior of relevant estimators. 
		Before that, I received my BS in Mathematics at Tongji University in Shanghai, China.</a></p>
