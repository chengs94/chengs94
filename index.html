	<p align="left">I am currently a first-year PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of Washington. 
		I obtained my MS degree in Biostatistics at Yale University, where I worked with 
		<a href="http://www.crawfordlab.io/">Dr. Forrest Crawford</a>
		on estimating hard-to-reach populations and detecting contagion effect in social networks. 
		Before that, I received my BS in Mathematics at Tongji University in Shanghai, China.</a></p>
