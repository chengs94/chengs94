	<p align="left">I am currently a second-year M.S. student in the Department of Biostatistics at Yale University, working with
		<a href="http://www.crawfordlab.io/">Dr. Forrest Crawford</a>. My research interest includes network analysis combined with
		optimization and computational techniques, as well as Bayesian methodology and high-dimensional estimation.
		Before coming to Yale, I received my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at Tongji University in China.</a></p>
